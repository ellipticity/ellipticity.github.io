This is just a collection of some of my thoughts, experiences and observations I've had working in STEM over the years. 

I don't claim anything on here to be terribly original, but I have been around long enough to acquire a perspective utterly devoid of fucks left to give. That isn't to say I'm here to fan the flames of enragement; there's already too much of that around on the inter-webs. Instead, I more try to think about what words would have really helped a younger version of myself: someone with half my problems and twice my worries. 

Unfortunately, there are no answers here and there never will be; but if something in here makes someone feel a little less alone in their thoughts, fears, experience, joys... whatever, then I'd consider the effort here well worth it.
