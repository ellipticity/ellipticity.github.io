So, 

So, this endeavour of starting a blog began with me reflecting on why people write tech. blogs to begin with. I know... already getting a bit meta right out of the gate but bear with me. Every now and again, I get asked if contributing to tech. blogs is a worthwhile endeavour in the context of professional progression in the tech. sector.

The TL;DR of the above is that I think tech. blogging _can_ be worthwhile, under certain sets of circumstances... obviously. However, I will cover my thoughts on this in Part 2 of this post.

For the vast majority of individual contributors (ICs) that ask me about this, I advocate putting time and effort into giving technical talks over online technical writing. There are a number of reasons for this:
- Blogs take time to get an established following. Sometimes you get lucky with getting featured in Tech. Crunch or something similar but this is the exception and not the rule. Writing in an established company blog can help mitigate this, but there still are no guarantees on uptake lag and reach.
- Blog relevance tends to be more ephemeral the more technical/specific the topic is. Conversely, posts with longer lasting relevance tend to focus more on higher level concepts in technical strategy and management principles, which tend to transcend the faster dynamics of the technologies they touch upon. Unfortunately, the knowledge and experience required to write about these topics typically only come to ICs later in their careers.
- Public speaking in a technical context is an invaluable skill to develop. In particular, distilling down technical concepts for clean and articulate presentations will help immensely when having to present/defend architectures or high-level technical designs or proposals typically required of more senior ICs. This ability also helps stakeholders build confidence in you and your ideas.
- Presenting at meetups/conferences is a great way to get your name out there in your local market/tech. community. In particular, many employers actively scout talks and presentations for potential candidates. If nothing else, giving talks furnishes solid opportunities for professional networking. As someone who is intensely introverted, I get this isn't necessarily appealing for most ICs; but the reality is that having at least _some_ semblance of a professional network will be helpful to anyone trying to build a career.
- Giving internal presentations within your own company is a great way to spread knowledge and experience. This is especially true is presenting on solutions to encountered issues or surprising technical "gotchas".
- While presentations do not have the _potential_ reach (number of people engaged) of a blog post, they tend to engender less engagement than most presentations. I.e. giving a talk to ~20 people at a meetup is normally going to be better than writing a blog that will frequently only get 1-2 people (really) reading it.
- With the potentially (much) higher reach of blog posts, there is also higher risk of some online calamity being raised around errors, views or tone presented in the writing, which can have significant consequences for individuals and businesses.

As you can see, my list of reasons is pretty long; hence why I rarely advocate online tech. writing over presentations. This is true even for more senior ICs, as I find it fairly common for senior+ ICs to have under-developed communication and presentation skills.

Take the above for what you will. Personally, I have benefited immensely as a working professional by giving many technical talks in my current and past careers for all the above reasons (and more); and while I have had some very modest success in uptake of past blog posts, I have to say it's not impacted my career progression one way or another. Of course, YMMV.

Even for many more senior ICs, most of the time I feel it's better to focus on developing stronger communication skills through giving presentations, as opposed to writing technical blogs. 

This is not to say that I think tech. blogs are useless or should not be pursued (obviously). Like most things, there is a context where I think they can work very well but not necessarily for the purposes they are typically intended, but I will save those thoughts for this posts' sequel.

Indeed, I think blogs can be written to have a more lasting relevance and impact, but I will save those thoughts for this posts' sequel.



In almost all cases, my view is that writing blog posts is really not the most efficient way to progress one's career in the tech. industry; and no, I do not view _this_ blog as any sort of exception. This is especially true when you are just starting out in a new career, field or domain. The cold reality is that there is no shortage of tech. blogs and stack exchange posts out there, and it is more likely that someone new to the field will struggle to find something genuinely meaningful (and sufficiently differentiated) to write about. If one gets an idea for something to write about, there is a good chance that many others have already done so. 

This is not to mention the possible damage that could be caused to someone's career/reputation by their online writing. There are countless examples of this, and 

I am not saying that one needs a novel topic or idea to justify writing. Indeed, the vast majority of great ideas and thoughts are re-discovered over and over again; and this is a very good thing. If this were not the case, such thoughts would quickly become victims of time and social entropy. Moreover, the best thoughts get stronger when they are thought about in different ways and in different contexts. Unfortunately, blogging (especially tech. blogging) seems to suffer from a strong selection bias: the same kinds of people writing about the same things over and over. I'm sure some are still excited to read the next exec. post or another "disruptive" idea from someone brand new to the industry... but many of us just are not. 

Ok, so are blogs hopeless? No, I really don't think so. There is a lot of noise in a sea of opinions, but there are some real great insights too. My hope is that we start figuring out how to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of these thoughts, as we try to find out feet in this "post scarcity" age.

Coming back to some more tangible thoughts. One point I'd like to see more of in online writing is embracing that good ideas are seldom had in isolation. The drive to be unique, shocking, novel... whatever is not needed and is just not remotely realistic. If an old idea or thought that has impacted you profoundly, then it may well be worth writing something about and is probably a lot more relatable than trying to push an idea as being 'totally novel', 'disruptive', etc.

The other point I'd like to see more of is writing reflecting what writers actually _struggle_ with. So much writing focuses on emotional extremes of what people find cool, interesting, novel, terrible, unjust etc. (which also applies very much to tech. writing). Such content rarely depicts any sort of genuine struggle within the author; usually the writing simply proclaims their opinion and/or analysis of a situation. Like it or not, having strong views on whatever is nothing new and proclaiming them online (no matter how well-supported) rarely transpires into anything more than preaching to the choir inside a dumpster fire. That being said, I know that writing about topics you have struggled with _is not fun_. Indeed, reliving difficult and/or challenging experiences in writing is nothing I imagine most people would ever do willingly (for many good reasons). However, these are the stories and experiences I find to be really the most impactful to me as a reader. The best, most profound knowledge is very hard won in its re-discovery. This could be something as simple as someone recalling how they dealt with a particular stressful production issue; the journey of someone deciding to change careers; or maybe a new hire struggling with imposter syndrome. I know all these topics have been written about, but I think we need more of them to boost that signal-to-noise ratio.

Coming back around to why _I_ decided to write this is because I'm still struggling to figure out if encouraging engineers to write online is a good or bad thing. To break this stalemate, I decided to writing this blog to see how my thoughts would actually start to pan out. I'm still not strongly decided in either direction, but I have decided to set up editing support for our engineers who want to pursue technical blogging.
