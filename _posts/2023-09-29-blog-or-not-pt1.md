So, 

So, this endeavour of starting a blog began with me reflecting on why people write tech. blogs to begin with. I know... already getting a bit meta right out of the gate but bear with me. Every now and again, I get asked if contributing to tech. blogs is a worthwhile endeavour in the context of professional progression in the tech. sector.

The TL;DR of the above is that I think tech. blogging _can_ be worthwhile, under certain sets of circumstances... obviously. However, I will cover my thoughts on this in Part 2 of this post.

For the vast majority of individual contributors (ICs) that ask me about this, I advocate putting time and effort into giving technical talks over online technical writing. There are a number of reasons for this:
- Blogs take time to get an established following. Sometimes you get lucky with getting featured in Tech. Crunch or something similar but this is the exception and not the rule. Writing in an established company blog can help mitigate this, but there still are no guarantees on uptake lag and reach.
- Blog relevance tends to be more ephemeral the more technical/specific the topic is. Conversely, posts with longer lasting relevance tend to focus more on higher level concepts in technical strategy and management principles, which tend to transcend the faster dynamics of the technologies they touch upon. Unfortunately, the knowledge and experience required to write about these topics typically only come to ICs later in their careers.
- Public speaking in a technical context is an invaluable skill to develop. In particular, distilling down technical concepts for clean and articulate presentations will help immensely when having to present/defend architectures or high-level technical designs or proposals typically required of more senior ICs. This ability also helps stakeholders build confidence in you and your ideas.
- Presenting at meetups/conferences is a great way to get your name out there in your local market/tech. community. In particular, many employers actively scout talks and presentations for potential candidates. If nothing else, giving talks furnishes solid opportunities for professional networking. As someone who is intensely introverted, I get this isn't necessarily appealing for most ICs; but the reality is that having at least _some_ semblance of a professional network will be helpful to anyone trying to build a career.
- Giving internal presentations within your own company is a great way to spread knowledge and experience. This is especially true is presenting on solutions to encountered issues or surprising technical "gotchas".
- While presentations do not have the _potential_ reach (number of people engaged) of a blog post, they tend to engender less engagement than most presentations. I.e. giving a talk to ~20 people at a meetup is normally going to be better than writing a blog that will frequently only get 1-2 people (really) reading it.
- With the potentially (much) higher reach of blog posts, there is also higher risk of some online calamity being raised around errors, views or tone presented in the writing, which can have significant consequences for individuals and businesses.

As you can see, my list of reasons is pretty long; hence why I rarely advocate online tech. writing over presentations. This is true even for more senior ICs, as I find it fairly common for senior+ ICs to have under-developed communication and presentation skills.

Take the above for what you will. Personally, I have benefited immensely as a working professional by giving many technical talks in my current and past careers for all the above reasons (and more); and while I have had some very modest success in uptake of past blog posts, I have to say it's not impacted my career progression one way or another. Of course, YMMV.
